   <h1> Artificial Intelligence</h1>
     The fear of an artificial intelligence takeover has manifested itself in both novels and films repeatedly over the last century – basically ever since technology began to develop in the modern age. As technological advancements continue to rise, anxiety surrounding the idea has become more widespread and probable than ever before. Perhaps this fear isn’t totally unreasonable; not in the sense that mankind will become extinct, but instead a situation in which some of our jobs will. No need to panic; this could be a change that benefits us all.

Over the past decade, two models have been established as representations of the ideal talent pipeline: job-centric and candidate-centric. As shown in our research, the job market is shifting (at least for Best-in-Class companies) from focusing on the former to the latter. Read: Hiring Tomorrow’s Workforce Today: The Talent Pipeline

Traditionally, a job-centric pipeline has been the rule. A position opens, candidates apply, and the one who fits the role best is offered the job. This model relies on the “self-relevancy” of a potential employee. In other words, the candidate is responsible for understanding the position available and making sure that their skills align with it. Through this model, the pool of talent is only examined when a job is available, leaving the chance that potential leading candidates who could be successful in a different role within the company are overlooked or unavailable during that small window.

A candidate-centric pipeline, once the exception, has now become the most current among Best-in-Class companies who, as we know, are most likely to attract and retain top talent. The candidate-centric pipeline focuses on the long-term goals and culture of a company rather than the short-term goal of hiring a less skilled candidate to fill an empty position as soon as possible. By creating an attractive brand and culture within their business, Best-in-Class companies attract candidates who align with the brand itself and have potential to fill different roles as they become available. Focusing on the potential employee rather than the position available offers a continuous potential for growth and opportunity across the workforce as a whole. As shown in the table below, there are specific attributes that leading candidates look for when choosing an employer:
